```

## Usage
### A simple (but long) example
Here a simple example that show how create a pipeline that computes the first 20 numbers of Fibonacci.

This pipeline is composed by:
* A Source, that emits number from 1 to 20.
* A Stage that computes the i-th number of Fibonacci.
* A Sink that accumulates and return a Vec with the results.

Here a snipped of code to show how build this pipeline:
```rust
use ppl::{prelude::*, collections::misc::{SourceIter, Sequential, SinkVec}};

fn main() {
    let mut p = parallel![
        SourceIter::build(1..21),
        Sequential::build(fib), // fib is a method that computes the i-th number of Fibonacci
        SinkVec::build()
    ];
    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_and_collect()
        .unwrap().len();
    assert_eq!(res, 20)
}
```

In this example We're building a simple pipelin, so why not use clousure instead than the library templates?
```rust
use ppl::prelude::*;
    let mut p = parallel![
        {
            let mut counter = 0;
            move || {
                if counter < 20 {
                    counter += 1;
                    Some(counter)
                } else {
                    None
                }
            }
        },
        |input| Some(fibonacci_recursive(input)),
        {
            move |input| {
                println!("{}", input);
            }
        }
    ];
    p.start();
    p.wait_and_collect();
```

If We want to parallelize the computation We must find a part of this algorithm that can be parallelized.
In this case the stage in the middle is a good candidate, We replicate that stage introducing a Farm.

Now the code is as follows:
```rust
use ppl::{prelude::*, collections::misc::{SourceIter, Parallel, SinkVec}};

fn main() {
    let mut p = parallel![
        SourceIter::build(1..21),
        Parallel::build(8, fib), // We create 8 replicas of the stage seen in the previous code.
        SinkVec::build()
    ];
    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_and_collect()
        .unwrap().len();
    assert_eq!(res, 20)
}
```

If We don't want to use the templates offered by the library, there is the possibility to create custom stage.
By creating custom stages It is possible to add state and create more complicate nodes for our pipeline.

Here the same example but using custom defined stages:
```rust
use ppl::prelude::*;

struct Source {
    streamlen: usize,
    counter: usize,
}
impl Out<usize> for Source {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self) -> Option<usize> {
        if self.counter < self.streamlen {
            self.counter += 1;
            Some(self.counter)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Worker {}
impl InOut<usize, usize> for Worker {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self, input: usize) -> Option<usize> {
        Some(fib(input))
    }
}

struct Sink {
    counter: usize,
}
impl In<usize, usize> for Sink {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self, input: usize) {
        println!("{}", input);
        self.counter += 1;
    }
    // If at the end of the stream We want to return something, We can override the finalize method.
    fn finalize(self) -> Option<usize> {
        println!("End");
        Some(self.counter)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = parallel![
        Source {
            streamlen: 20,
            counter: 0
        },
        Worker {},
        Sink { counter: 0 }
    ];

    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_and_collect(); // Here We will get the counter returned by the Sink
    assert_eq!(res.unwrap(), 20);
}
```

Surely is more verbose, but allows to express a more variety of parallel computations in which each node can be stateful.

Parallelo also offers a powerful work-stealing threadpool. Using that instead, we can express the same parallel computation as following:

```rust
use ppl::thread_pool::ThreadPool;

fn main() {
    let tp = ThreadPool::new_with_global_registry(8); // We create a new threadpool
    for i in 1..45 {
        tp.execute(move || {
            fib(i);
        });
    }
    tp.wait(); // Wait till al worker have finished
}
```

More complex examples are available in *benches/*, *examples/*, and in *tests/*.

## Configuration

The configuration of Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL) can be customized by setting environment variables. The following environment variables are available:

- **PPL_MAX_CORES**: Specifies the maximum number of cores allowed. This configuration is only valid when pinning is active.

- **PPL_PINNING**: Enables or disables the pinning of partitions to the cores. By default, pinning is disabled (`false`).

- **PPL_SCHEDULE**: Specifies the scheduling method used in the pipeline. The available options are:
  - `static`: Static scheduling (default).
  - `dynamic`: Dynamic scheduling.

- **PPL_WAIT_POLICY**: Enables or disables the blocking channel. By default, the blocking channel is disabled (`false`).

- **PPL_THREAD_MAPPING**: Specifies the core mapping. By default, the threads are mapped in the order in which the cores are found.

To customize the configuration, set the desired environment variables before running your Rust program that uses PPL. For example, you can set the environment variables in your shell script or use a tool like `env_file` to load them from a file.

Please note that changing these configuration options may have an impact on the performance and behavior of your parallel computations. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal configuration for your specific use case.

## Channel Implementation

Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL) provides flexibility in choosing the channel implementation for multi-producer, single-consumer communication. Depending on your requirements and preferences, you can select the desired channel implementation at compile time using feature flags.

The default channel implementation in PPL is **crossbeam**.

Crossbeam is a highly performant channel implementation that provides efficient and reliable communication differents threads. It is well-suited for a wide range of parallel computing scenarios.

The available channel implementations are:

- **crossbeam**: Uses the crossbeam channel.
- **flume**: Uses the flume channel.
- **kanal**: Uses the kanal channel.
- **ff**: Uses a channel based on fastflow spsc queues (**EXP**).

To select a specific channel implementation, enable the corresponding feature flag during the build process. For example, to use the crossbeam channel implementation, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies.ppl]
features = ["crossbeam"]
```
